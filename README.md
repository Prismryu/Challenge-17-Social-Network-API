Challenge-17-Social-Network-API
NoSQL Social Network API
Description

This is a back-end API for a social network web application built using Express.js and MongoDB with Mongoose ODM. It allows users to share thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and manage friend lists. Designed for developers and businesses that want a scalable solution for managing social data without a front-end interface.

This API follows RESTful routing conventions and is fully testable via Insomnia. It demonstrates strong understanding of NoSQL database principles, data relationships, and server-side logic.
